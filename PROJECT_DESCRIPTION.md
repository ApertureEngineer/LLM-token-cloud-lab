# Project Description

The **LLM-Analyzer** project contains utilities for working with locally hosted
large language models via the [OLLAMA](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) API.
It explores how text maps to token ids and provides building blocks for
analysing token usage and visualising token frequencies.

Current components include:

* a minimal HTTP client for the OLLAMA API,
* tools for inspecting token indices and vocabulary size,
* helpers to build token frequency maps for future word cloud visualisations.

The repository is intended as a starting point for experimenting with
openâ€‘source models and analysing their token landscape.
